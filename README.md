# Divvy

Group expense tracking & splitting

> A work in progress

### Disclaimer 

Divvy is a personal side project. It was built primarily for my own personal educational purposes and as a
way to showcase my skills with particular technologies (see tech stack).

## Description

Divvy's primary goal is to track and split expenses between groups of people. Simply add participating
members, expenses, and then assign expenses to each member, or split all expenses evenly between everyone.

Results page will clearly show any expenses shared between the group, as well as any additional expenses assigned
to a particular member. Save the results locally in your browser and/or download results as an image/pdf.

## Use case

Admittedly, the use-case for Divvy is rather niche. In most cases, Divvy can simply be used as a tool
to quickly split expenses evenly between a group of people. But where Divvy truly shines is in its ability
to assign expenses at an individual level. This is particularly helpful when a large group of people are splitting
expenses with some members but not all of them, while others are paying for their own expenses.

## Tech Stack

Divvy is based on my own [HAX Stack](https://github.com/carlosrrdev/hax-stack-template.git) template. The core
technologies being HTML, Alpine.js, and HTMX. See template repo for more information.

## Contributions

As mentioned in the disclaimer, Divvy is a personal side project. I am not actively looking for any contributors.
However, if you have a feature you'd like to suggest, or encounter an issue, please feel free to submit a pull request!
I am open to any suggestions and constructive criticism.
